##Problem Statement: Peer-to-Peer Loan Approval System for a Client

Our client is an organization operating in a peer-to-peer lending model, where loans are facilitated through an online platform connecting borrowers with financial institutions or investors. The company aims to approve or disapprove loan applications based on the applicantâ€™s likelihood of repaying the loan, determined by a risk scoring system. As the data engineering team, your responsibility is to clean, process, and prepare the loan application data, as well as calculate the risk score to guide the loan approval process.

####Project Objective:
The client has provided raw loan application data from financial institutions, which requires cleaning, processing, and transformation before being used in decision-making. The data engineering team must ensure the data is properly structured and then calculate a risk score for each applicant. The risk score will indicate the likelihood of the applicant repaying the loan, helping the company decide whether to approve or reject the loan application.
